### Take-Home Task: Analytics Pipeline for Data Aggregation and Transformation

**Objective:**  
Design and implement a robust data aggregation and transformation pipeline that supports multiple data formats (CSV, JSON, SQL), integrates with APIs, and enforces schema consistency. This pipeline should adhere to industry best practices, support error handling, and demonstrate proficiency with OOP concepts, including operator overloading and custom exception handling.

### Problem Statement:

You are tasked with building an analytics pipeline that ingests data from different sources (CSV, JSON, SQL, and APIs), aggregates it, and transforms it into a standardized format. The system should handle various error cases gracefully, ensuring robust and flexible data processing.

### **Part 1: Class Structure & Requirements**

#### 1. **`DataSource` (Base Class)**
   - **Attributes:**
     - `file_path`: Location of the file or database connection string.
     - `schema`: Defines the structure of the data (columns, types, etc.).
   - **Abstract Method:**
     - `load_data()`: Loads the data from the source. Each subclass will implement this based on the file format or API.
   - **Concrete Method:**
     - `transform_data()`: Standardizes the data (e.g., renaming columns, data type conversion).

#### 2. **`CSVSource`, `JSONSource`, `SQLSource` (Derived Classes)**
   - Each inherits from `DataSource` and implements `load_data()`. Methods will handle:
     - `CSVSource`: Loads data via `pandas.read_csv()`.
     - `JSONSource`: Loads data via `pandas.read_json()`.
     - `SQLSource`: Loads data using SQL queries via `pandas.read_sql()`.

#### 3. **`APIDataSource` (Derived Class from `JSONSource`)**
   - **Attributes:**
     - `api_endpoint`: URL of the API.
     - `headers`: Authentication or custom headers required to access the API.
   - **Methods:**
     - `load_data()`: Fetches data from the API using `requests.get()` and parses it as JSON. Raise `APIError` for failures.
     - Supports retry logic for handling intermittent failures.
   
#### 4. **`ProcessedSource` (Derived Class from `DataSource`)**
   - Overrides `transform_data()` to implement additional cleaning, such as handling null values or applying specific data transformations.
   - This class is meant for applying additional transformations beyond the base class.

### **Part 2: Aggregation and Operator Overloading**

#### 1. **`Aggregator` Class**
   - **Operator Overloading:**
     - Overload the `+` operator to combine data from two `DataSource` objects. This should merge their datasets based on a common schema (e.g., via `pandas.merge()`).
     - If schemas donâ€™t match, raise a `SchemaMismatchError`.
   - **Additional Operator Overloading Tasks:**
     - Overload the `==` operator to compare whether two `DataSource` objects contain equivalent data.
     - Overload the `[]` operator to access specific columns in the dataset by indexing into the `DataSource`.

---

### **Part 3: Error Handling**

#### 1. **Custom Exceptions:**
   - `FileFormatError`: Raised for unsupported or incorrect file formats.
   - `SchemaMismatchError`: Raised when datasets being aggregated do not have matching schemas.
   - `APIError`: Raised when API requests fail (e.g., 404 or 500 responses).
   - Implement error handling for file loading issues, connection errors, and data validation problems.

---

### **Part 4: Additional Features**

#### 1. **Data Standardization:**
   - Implement schema validation to ensure consistency across data sources. Schema mismatches should be identified, and appropriate errors raised.
   - Support API data transformation, including handling complex nested JSON and converting it into a tabular format.

#### 2. **API Integration:**
   - Support loading data from external APIs. The API should return JSON data, which is parsed into a DataFrame.
   - Handle different response codes (e.g., 401, 500) with appropriate retry logic and error handling.

---

### **Part 5: Test Cases and Expectations**

#### **Test 1: Basic File Validation**
   - Load a CSV file using `CSVSource`. Ensure correct loading and validate the format.
   - Trigger a `FileFormatError` by attempting to load a non-CSV file.

#### **Test 2: Schema Mismatch Handling**
   - Load two datasets with differing schemas and attempt to aggregate them.
   - Ensure that a `SchemaMismatchError` is raised.

#### **Test 3: Aggregation & Operator Overloading**
   - Test the `+` operator by merging data from two `DataSource` objects.
   - Ensure data is combined correctly when schemas match.
   - Test the `==` operator by comparing two datasets for equality.
   - Test the `[]` operator by accessing specific columns in the dataset.

#### **Test 4: API Data Fetching and Error Handling**
   - Load data from an API using `APIDataSource`. Simulate a network failure and ensure that `APIError` is raised.
   - Ensure the retry logic works as expected by simulating transient failures.

#### **Test 5: Data Transformation**
   - Apply the `transform_data()` method on `ProcessedSource` and ensure transformations such as column renaming, typecasting, and null value handling are applied.

#### **Test 6: Advanced API Integration**
   - Fetch and transform data from a real-world API, ensure the transformation works as expected, and validate schema consistency.

### **Deliverables**

1. **Source Code:**
   - Complete implementation of the pipeline, including the required classes and error handling.

2. **Test Suite:**
   - A comprehensive test suite covering all the test cases listed above, ensuring correctness of the solution.

3. **Documentation:**
   - Explanation of the design decisions, how the classes interact, and examples of how to use the pipeline.

### Bonus Challenges

- **Retry Mechanism for API Failures:** Implement a configurable retry mechanism for failed API requests.
- **Performance Optimization:** Analyze and improve the performance of the data aggregation pipeline, particularly for large datasets.
- **Concurrency:** Introduce parallel processing for data loading and transformations where applicable.
